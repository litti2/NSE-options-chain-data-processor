NSE Option Chain Data Fetching and Premium Calculation
This project is a Python application that retrieves option chain data from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) for a given instrument and calculates the premium earned based on the bid/ask prices. It also includes a placeholder margin calculation for demonstration purposes.

Project Structure and Code Logic
Code Structure:

The application is organized into three main functions:
get_nse_option_chain: Fetches option chain data from the NSE API, parses JSON, and extracts relevant bid or ask prices for specified options (Call - "CE" or Put - "PE").
calculate_margin_and_premium: Calculates the premium earned based on the bid/ask prices and a specified lot_size. Adds a placeholder column for margin_required.
main: Orchestrates data retrieval and calculations, displaying the final DataFrame with premium information.
Data Retrieval:

Uses the requests library to send an HTTP GET request to the NSE API. This data is parsed and organized into a pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and further calculations.
Premium and Margin Calculation:

The function calculate_margin_and_premium multiplies the bid/ask price by the lot_size to compute the premium_earned.
A fixed placeholder value is added for margin_required, which can later be updated to pull real margin values from a financial API.
Logging:

Configured using Python's logging library to capture essential messages, including errors and warnings, which aids in debugging and monitoring.
Approach
This project is modular, making it easy to modify, expand, or replace parts without affecting the entire application. The placeholder for margin_required is a template that allows easy future expansion to integrate more detailed financial calculations.

AI Tools Used
OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT was used to:

Provide troubleshooting insights.
Refine code readability, error handling, and modular structure.
Draft documentation for this README.md file, ensuring clarity in explaining the code structure and approach.
These AI tools were valuable in creating clean, readable code and comprehensive documentation that outlines the project approach clearly and concisely.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Dependencies: Install via pip:


pip install requests pandas

To run the script:


python script_name.py
Replace script_name.py with your script's actual filename. Ensure you have an internet connection for the API request to function correctly.
